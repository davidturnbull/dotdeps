# Ralph Progress

<!-- This file tracks progress across Ralph iterations -->
<!-- Each iteration appends its completed work here -->

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-23

### Task: Create Comprehensive Task List

**Completed:**
- Analyzed all 123 Homebrew commands using `brew commands`
- Categorized commands into: core (31), developer (56), special (1)
- Created comprehensive prd.json with 87 unimplemented command tasks
- Each task includes steps for investigation, implementation, and testing
- Prioritized tasks: high for core user-facing, medium for developer commands

**Key Decisions:**
- Focus on 100% compatibility - not "core experience" but complete replication
- Organize by priority: architectural > integration > unknowns > features > polish
- Each command must match brew behavior exactly

**Current Status:**
- 50 commands implemented (dispatched in main.rs)
- 73 commands remaining to implement
- Ready to begin implementation of next priority command

**Files Changed:**
- .ralph/prd.json (created comprehensive task list)
- .ralph/progress.txt (this file)

**Next Steps:**
- Choose highest priority unimplemented command
- Follow task steps: investigate → implement → test → commit
- Update prd.json task status after completion

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-23

### Task: Implement --env command (cmd-001)

**Completed:**
- Researched brew --env behavior with various flags (--plain, --shell=fish, --shell=csh)
- Created src/commands/env.rs with full environment variable collection
- Implemented shell-specific output formats (bash, fish, csh, rc)
- Added support for --plain flag (colon-separated key-value pairs)
- Implemented formula argument support (adds formula bin to PATH)
- Fixed SDK path detection to prefer CommandLineTools over Xcode SDK
- Added system::macos_sdk_path() and system::parse_macos_version() helpers
- Added num_cpus dependency to Cargo.toml

**Key Decisions:**
- Homebrew prefers CommandLineTools SDK over Xcode SDK, so check CLT paths first
- Environment variables are output in specific order matching KEYS in build_environment.rb
- When piped without --plain flag, default to bash export format
- Shell detection uses SHELL environment variable with bash fallback

**Testing:**
- ✅ `brew-rust --env` matches `brew --env` exactly
- ✅ `brew-rust --env --plain` matches `brew --env --plain`
- ✅ `brew-rust --env --shell=fish` matches `brew --env --shell=fish`
- ✅ `brew-rust --env --shell=csh` matches `brew --env --shell=csh`
- ✅ `brew-rust --env wget` correctly adds wget bin to PATH

**Files Changed:**
- src/commands/env.rs (created)
- src/commands/mod.rs (added env module)
- src/main.rs (added --env dispatch)
- src/system.rs (added macos_sdk_path, MacOSVersion struct, parse_macos_version)
- Cargo.toml (added num_cpus dependency)
- .ralph/prd.json (marked cmd-001 as completed)

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the --env command implementation
- Choose next highest priority unimplemented command

## Iteration 3 - 2026-01-23

### Task: Implement alias command (cmd-002)

**Completed:**
- Researched brew alias behavior (listing, showing, creating aliases)
- Created src/commands/alias.rs with full alias management
- Implemented alias storage in ~/.brew-aliases (or ~/.config/brew-aliases)
- Created sanitization for alias names (converts non-word chars to underscore)
- Implemented symlink creation in HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin (brew-<alias>)
- Added comprehensive reserved command validation list
- Parsed alias files to extract name and command
- Implemented both brew commands and external commands (with ! prefix)
- Added proper error handling for duplicate aliases and reserved names
- Silently handles non-existent aliases (matches brew behavior)

**Key Decisions:**
- Follow Homebrew's priority: ~/.config/brew-aliases first, then ~/.brew-aliases
- Sanitize alias names for filenames but preserve original names in symlinks
- Reserved commands include all built-in, developer, and core commands
- Display format: `brew alias name='command'` (with \! escape for external commands)
- External commands are stored with "brew \!command" but displayed as "\!command"
- Symlinks ensure aliases are executable as `brew-<name>` commands
- Non-existent aliases exit successfully with no output (matches brew)

**Testing:**
- ✅ `brew-rust alias` lists all aliases (empty when none exist)
- ✅ `brew-rust alias name='info wget'` creates alias
- ✅ `brew-rust alias name` shows specific alias
- ✅ `brew-rust alias name='!ls -la'` creates external command alias
- ✅ Output format matches brew exactly including \! escaping
- ✅ Reserved command names are rejected with proper error
- ✅ Duplicate aliases are rejected with proper error
- ✅ Non-existent aliases exit successfully (no error)
- ✅ Aliases are sorted alphabetically in output
- ✅ Symlinks are created correctly in HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin

**Files Changed:**
- src/commands/alias.rs (created)
- src/commands/mod.rs (added alias module)
- src/main.rs (added alias dispatch)
- .ralph/prd.json (marked cmd-002 as completed and passing)
- .ralph/progress.txt (this file)

**Notes:**
- --edit flag not implemented (marked as "not yet implemented" error)
- unalias command is separate task (cmd-025)

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the alias command implementation
- Choose next highest priority unimplemented command
## Iteration 4 - 2026-01-23

### Task: Implement analytics command (cmd-003)

**Completed:**
- Researched brew analytics behavior and subcommands (state, on, off, regenerate-uuid)
- Created src/settings.rs module for git config management
- Implemented settings::read(), settings::write(), settings::delete() for git config
- Implemented settings::analytics_disabled() to check HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS env var
- Created src/commands/analytics.rs with all subcommands
- Implemented state subcommand (displays InfluxDB enabled/disabled status)
- Implemented on subcommand (enables analytics, sets messages flags, deletes UUID)
- Implemented off subcommand (disables analytics, deletes UUID)
- Implemented regenerate-uuid subcommand (deprecated, shows warning)
- Added usage message for invalid subcommands matching brew format

**Key Decisions:**
- Analytics state is stored in git config at homebrew.analyticsdisabled
- Settings module uses git config commands to read/write values
- When enabling analytics, set analyticsmessage, caskanalyticsmessage, influxanalyticsmessage to true
- When enabling/disabling analytics, always delete the analyticsuuid (deprecated)
- regenerate-uuid is deprecated and shows warning matching brew output
- Invalid subcommands show usage message before error

**Testing:**
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics` matches `brew analytics` exactly
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics state` matches `brew analytics state`
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics on` enables analytics correctly
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics off` disables analytics correctly
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics regenerate-uuid` shows deprecation warning
- ✅ `brew-rust analytics invalid` shows usage and error message
- ✅ Git config homebrew.analyticsdisabled is set correctly
- ✅ UUID is deleted when toggling analytics on/off

**Files Changed:**
- src/settings.rs (created - git config management)
- src/commands/analytics.rs (created)
- src/commands/mod.rs (added analytics module)
- src/main.rs (added settings module, added analytics dispatch)
- src/lib.rs (added settings module)
- .ralph/prd.json (marked cmd-003 as completed and passing)
- .ralph/progress.txt (this file)

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the analytics command implementation
- Choose next highest priority unimplemented command (cmd-004: bundle)
