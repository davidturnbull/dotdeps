## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-23

### Task: Create Comprehensive Task List

**Completed:**
- Analyzed all 123 Homebrew commands using `brew commands`
- Categorized commands into: core (31), developer (56), special (1)
- Created comprehensive prd.json with 87 unimplemented command tasks
- Each task includes steps for investigation, implementation, and testing
- Prioritized tasks: high for core user-facing, medium for developer commands

**Key Decisions:**
- Focus on 100% compatibility - not "core experience" but complete replication
- Organize by priority: architectural > integration > unknowns > features > polish
- Each command must match brew behavior exactly

**Current Status:**
- 50 commands implemented (dispatched in main.rs)
- 73 commands remaining to implement
- Ready to begin implementation of next priority command

**Files Changed:**
- .ralph/prd.json (created comprehensive task list)
- .ralph/progress.txt (this file)

**Next Steps:**
- Choose highest priority unimplemented command
- Follow task steps: investigate → implement → test → commit
- Update prd.json task status after completion
