Usage: brew uses [options] formula [...]

Show formulae and casks that specify formula as a dependency; that is, show
dependents of formula. When given multiple formula arguments, show the
intersection of formulae that use formula. By default, uses shows all
formulae and casks that specify formula as a required or recommended
dependency for their stable builds.

Note: --missing and --skip-recommended have precedence over --include-*.

      --recursive                  Resolve more than one level of dependencies.
      --installed                  Only list formulae and casks that are
                                   currently installed.
      --eval-all                   Evaluate all available formulae and casks,
                                   whether installed or not, to show their
                                   dependents.
      --include-build              Include formulae that specify formula as a
                                   :build dependency.
      --include-test               Include formulae that specify formula as a
                                   :test dependency.
      --include-optional           Include formulae that specify formula as an
                                   :optional dependency.
      --skip-recommended           Skip all formulae that specify formula as a
                                   :recommended dependency.
      --formula, --formulae        Include only formulae.
      --cask, --casks              Include only casks.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
